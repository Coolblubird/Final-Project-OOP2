# DaisukiItchi by Jordan Ashe

## Synopsis
DaisukiItchi is meant to be a Tamagotchi-esque program that instead of being taken care of, the program is meant to help users take care of themselves.

## How to Run
Every file in the Github (with maybe the exception of this README.md and the .gitignore) are needed to run. The file you want to specifically
open is called "DakisukiItchi.java" to run the program.
